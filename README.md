HAHAHA!I am a freshman in Sun-Yet-Sen UNIVERSITY,a university in China!
My major is a branch of computer science.
To be honest,i don't konw whether coding is my favourite thing ,but one thing i am sure is that i want to do some coding now,and i really feel excited for it!
And that's enough, isn't that???
I am happy to join in the GitHub family!
